for this app.

Then, open up a terminal and install Ionic:
```bash
$ npm install -g cordova ionic
```

Lastly, install all dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
$ ionic state reset
```

To simply run this app in a browser:
```bash
$ cd path/to/project
$ ionic serve
```

Or, to build and run this app on a specific platform:

When Ionic asks you for an address, enter in localhost.

To start developing, all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are located in `www/`.
